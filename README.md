# CS305_Software_Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates individualized financial plans for their customers. They were looking for a software to modernize their company and needed someone to specifically look at software security to protect the company and their customers from threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  I think I did well understanding the overall process of identifying vulnerabilities and researching how they can be fixed. Getting an understanding of the dependency check is important and while I still need to learn more about it I think I have a pretty good understanding of how to create and analyze one. Security adds value to the company's wellbeing because it protects them, their customers, their reputation, and their information from being used improperly.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I had a particularly hard time with checksum verification but I think I need to get a better understanding of Spring Boot frameworks in order to round out my knowledge about checksum verification.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  To increase layers of security, make sure to keep updated software, APIs, etc. as they tend to have known vulnerabilities and can help mitigate them. It's also important to understand how to actually script the code to be more secure by adding in various checks to prevent hackers bypassing sercurity measures.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  Rerun a dependency check and see what comes up. I had to run and suppress multiple vulnerabilities when I finished the project as new vulnerabilities came up, which again were mostly outdated software that needed to be fixed.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  Dependency checks, verifications, certificates, etc.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would show them my ability to run a dependency check and analyze vulnerabilities so they know that I have a basic understanding of software security and that it's something I would be aware of as I develop programs.
